# Apple Proto 1

Welcome to the README file for Apple Proto 1. This README provides an overview of the HTML and JavaScript files and their functionality.

## Overview
Apple Proto 1 was my first HTML / CSS and JavaScript project used to display an image of an apple and allows users to increase or decrease a counter by clicking corresponding button.
The image also serves as a Update function that resets the counter to [0]. 

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `Apple Proto.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, including the apple image and counter. Formatting is rare with barely style functions implemented. 
2. `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the functions to handle the counter interactions.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file contains three functions:
- `handleDecrease()`: Decreases the counter value by 1 when the "-" button is clicked.
- `handleIncrease()`: Increases the counter value by 1 when the "+" button is clicked.
- `handleUpdate()`: Resets the counter value to 0 when the apple image is clicked.

## Credits

This prototype was created by Shane V for educational purposes.
