# Apple Proto 1

Welcome to the README file for Apple Proto 1. This README provides an overview of the HTML and JavaScript files and their functionality.

## Overview
Apple Proto 1 was my first HTML / CSS project used to display an image of an apple and allows users to increase or decrease a counter by clicking corresponding button.
The image also serves as a Update function that resets the counter to [0]. 

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `AppleProto.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, including the apple image and counter.
2. `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the functions to handle the counter interactions.

## HTML Structure

The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the webpage, including an image of an apple and buttons to increase or decrease the counter. The counter value is displayed between the buttons.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file contains three functions:
- `handleDecrease()`: Decreases the counter value by 1 when the "-" button is clicked.
- `handleIncrease()`: Increases the counter value by 1 when the "+" button is clicked.
- `handleUpdate()`: Resets the counter value to 0 when the apple image is clicked.

## How to Use

To use the webpage, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can click the "+" and "-" buttons to increase or decrease the counter value, respectively. Clicking the apple image resets the counter to 0.

## Customization

You can customize the webpage by modifying the HTML and JavaScript files. Feel free to update the content, styling, or add new features to suit your needs.
